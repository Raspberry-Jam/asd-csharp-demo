# asd-csharp-demo
A basic demo project to evaluate the ease of use of C# and its available .NET libraries for making a simple web application.

### Setup
I will expand on this with proper instructions soon. This is just an overview
- Restore project
- Update database (apply migrations)

This will install all the NuGet dependency packages, and generate the SQLite db file.
